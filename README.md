# My Journey: Google's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course


Welcome to my repository for the **Google & Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** (November 9-14, 2025). This repo serves as my personal log, code notebook, and project hub as I dive deep into the world of intelligent AI agents.

I'll be sharing my progress, notes, and code daily. Follow along!

## 🎯 My Goal

As an aspiring machine learning engineer, I'm already passionate about building models that can predict and classify. This course is the perfect next step: learning how to build the "brain" that can *use* those models to perform complex tasks, reason, and interact with the world.

My primary goal is to bridge the gap between standalone ML models and fully autonomous, intelligent systems. Oh, and to earn that Kaggle badge! 🏅
