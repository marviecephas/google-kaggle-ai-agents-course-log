Here are some of the most significant and recent trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Beyond Optimization, Towards Creation:** While AI has been used to optimize existing drug molecules for a while, generative AI models (like those based on transformers or diffusion models) are now capable of *creating entirely novel molecular structures* from scratch.\n*   **Targeting Specific Properties:** These models can be trained to design molecules that possess desired characteristics like high binding affinity to a target protein, good solubility, low toxicity, or favorable pharmacokinetic properties.\n*   **Accelerated Exploration:** This drastically expands the chemical space that researchers can explore, potentially uncovering compounds that traditional methods would never find.\n*   **Examples:** Insilico Medicine, Atomwise, and deepmind (with AlphaFold's insights leading to potential drug targets) are active in this area.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Leveraging Multi-omics Data:** AI is becoming increasingly adept at integrating and analyzing diverse biological data sources – genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and even patient electronic health records (EHRs). This holistic approach helps identify novel disease targets that might not be apparent from analyzing single data types.\n*   **Understanding Disease Pathways:** AI can map out complex biological pathways and identify key nodes that, when modulated by a drug, could effectively treat a disease.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** Algorithms are being developed to predict whether a newly identified target is \"druggable,\" meaning whether it's feasible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Improved Predictive Modeling for Preclinical Success:**\n\n*   **\"In Silico\" Trials:** AI is being used to build more accurate models that can predict a drug candidate's efficacy and potential toxicity *before* it enters costly and time-consuming lab experiments or clinical trials.\n*   **ADMET Prediction:** Advanced AI models are improving predictions for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties, helping to filter out unpromising candidates early.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict a patient's response to a drug, which is crucial for developing companion diagnostics and stratifying patient populations for clinical trials.\n\n**4. AI in Clinical Trial Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Smart Patient Selection:** AI can sift through vast patient datasets to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from a particular investigational drug or meet specific trial criteria, speeding up recruitment.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** Models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for a clinical trial, allowing for better resource allocation and faster decision-making.\n*   **Synthetic Control Arms:** In some cases, AI can help create \"synthetic\" control arms using real-world data, potentially reducing the need for large placebo groups and accelerating trials.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Life for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze existing drug databases and compare their mechanisms of action and side effect profiles with disease signatures to identify potential new therapeutic uses for approved drugs. This is a faster and often less risky path to new treatments.\n\n**6. Advancements in Protein Structure Prediction (e.g., AlphaFold):**\n\n*   **Foundation for Drug Design:** While not directly a drug discovery tool, breakthroughs like DeepMind's AlphaFold have revolutionized our understanding of protein structures. Knowing the precise 3D shape of a disease-related protein is fundamental for designing drugs that can bind to it effectively. This has opened up new avenues for targeting previously \"undruggable\" proteins.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Recent Developments:**\n\n*   **Generative AI is a game-changer:** Moving from optimization to true de novo design.\n*   **Data integration is paramount:** AI's power grows exponentially with access to diverse, high-quality biological data.\n*   **Focus on reducing failure rates:** AI is being used to de-risk the drug discovery process by improving predictions at every stage.\n*   **Speed and efficiency:** The overarching goal is to significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost of bringing new therapies to patients.\n\nThe field is moving incredibly fast, with new AI algorithms and applications being published and commercialized constantly.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation.**\n\nThis area is crucial because a successful drug discovery program hinges on identifying the right biological target (like a specific protein, enzyme, or gene) that plays a critical role in a disease. If you target the wrong thing, even the best drug molecule won't work.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing target identification and validation:\n\n**The Challenge Before AI:**\n\n*   **Siloed Data:** Biological research historically produced data in silos. Genomics data was analyzed separately from proteomics data, which was separate from clinical observations, etc. This made it hard to see the \"big picture.\"\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Diseases are rarely caused by a single factor. They involve intricate networks of interactions within cells and between different biological systems. Understanding these complex pathways was incredibly difficult and time-consuming for human researchers.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-causing proteins were known, but their structure or function made them very hard to design drugs for using traditional methods.\n*   **Bias in Research:** Research often focused on well-studied pathways, potentially missing novel and important targets.\n\n**How AI is Making a Difference:**\n\n1.  **Multi-omics Integration:**\n    *   **What it means:** AI algorithms can process and find patterns in massive datasets from different \"omics\" layers simultaneously:\n        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, gene mutations.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** Gene expression levels (RNA).\n        *   **Proteomics:** Protein abundance and modifications.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Levels of small molecules (metabolites).\n        *   **Epigenomics:** Changes in gene activity not due to DNA sequence alterations.\n    *   **How AI helps:** By integrating these diverse data types, AI can reveal how genetic variations influence gene expression, protein production, and ultimately, metabolic changes that contribute to disease. It can identify key drivers of disease that might be missed when looking at just one omics layer.\n    *   **Example:** AI might find that a specific gene mutation (genomics) leads to increased expression of a certain protein (proteomics), which in turn disrupts a metabolic pathway (metabolomics), all of which is associated with a particular disease outcome.\n\n2.  **Network Analysis and Pathway Mapping:**\n    *   **What it means:** AI can build sophisticated models of biological networks, showing how different molecules (genes, proteins, metabolites) interact with each other.\n    *   **How AI helps:** It can identify critical \"hubs\" or \"bottlenecks\" within these networks that are central to disease processes. Targeting these central nodes can have a more profound effect than targeting peripheral ones. AI can also predict how perturbing one part of the network might affect other parts.\n    *   **Example:** In cancer, AI can map the complex signaling pathways that drive tumor growth and identify key proteins that, if inhibited, could shut down multiple growth signals.\n\n3.  **Leveraging Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n    *   **What it means:** AI can analyze anonymized data from electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, patient registries, and wearable devices.\n    *   **How AI helps:** This RWD/RWE can provide insights into how diseases progress in large, diverse populations and how different treatments (or lack thereof) impact outcomes. AI can identify correlations between specific biological markers and disease development or progression that might not be apparent in controlled lab settings. This can point to novel targets or biomarkers associated with specific patient subgroups.\n\n4.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it means:** Once a potential target is identified, the next question is: can we actually make a drug for it?\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI models can be trained on known drug-target interactions and the structural/functional properties of successful drugs. They can then predict the likelihood that a newly identified target will be \"druggable\" by analyzing its protein structure (often aided by tools like AlphaFold), its binding pockets, and its role in cellular machinery. This saves significant time and resources by not pursuing targets that are unlikely to yield a viable drug.\n\n5.  **\"Omics\" Pattern Recognition in Rare Diseases:**\n    *   **What it means:** Rare diseases often have complex genetic underpinnings and are hard to diagnose.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can analyze the omics data of patients with rare diseases to identify common patterns or genetic signatures that might have been overlooked. This can lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for these under-served conditions.\n\n**In essence, AI is turning vast amounts of complex biological data into actionable insights, helping researchers pinpoint the most promising targets for new drug development with greater accuracy and efficiency than ever before.** This significantly increases the chances of success in the early, high-failure stages of the drug discovery pipeline.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about companies actively involved in **AI for Target Identification and Validation**.

Their platform is designed to uncover novel insights and hypotheses, including the identification of new drug targets for various diseases.\n*   **Schrödinger:** While famous for its physics-based computational chemistry, Schrödinger has increasingly incorporated AI and machine learning into its platform. They use these tools to enhance their ability to predict target-disease associations and the properties of potential drug candidates.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** As mentioned before, Insilico is strong in generative AI for molecule design. However, their platform also includes modules for target discovery and validation, often by analyzing complex biological pathways and identifying novel intervention points.\n\n**2. Companies with a Strong Genomics/Genetics Focus:**\n\nThese companies leverage AI to make sense of genetic and genomic data for target discovery.\n\n*   **Tempus:** Tempus focuses on precision medicine, collecting vast amounts of clinical and molecular data (including genomics). Their AI platform analyzes this data to identify biomarkers, understand disease drivers, and ultimately discover targets relevant to specific patient populations.\n*   **Ginkgo Bioworks:** While primarily a synthetic biology company, Ginkgo uses AI and machine learning extensively to design and optimize biological systems, including identifying novel gene targets or metabolic pathways for various applications, including drug discovery.\n\n**3. Companies Specializing in Data Integration and Knowledge Graphs:**\n\nThese companies focus on building intelligent systems that can connect disparate pieces of biological information to uncover new relationships.\n\n*   **Etsy (formerly known as Dataworks | AI):** While more of a general AI platform company, they have capabilities in integrating complex datasets, which can be applied to biological data for target identification. (Note: Company names and focus can shift, so this is an example of the *type* of company.)\n*   **Many academic spin-offs and smaller biotech companies:** Often emerge with specialized AI approaches to analyze specific types of biological data or tackle particular disease areas.\n\n**4. Big Pharma's Internal AI Efforts and Partnerships:**\n\nMajor pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in building their own internal AI capabilities or partnering with AI-focused biotechs.\n\n*   **Roche, Novartis, Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, etc.:** These companies have dedicated AI/data science teams working on target identification, validation, and the entire drug discovery pipeline. They often acquire smaller companies or form strategic alliances to access cutting-edge AI technologies.\n*   **Partnerships:** You'll frequently see announcements of collaborations between large pharma and AI drug discovery startups, where the startup's AI platform is used to analyze the pharma company's proprietary data for target discovery and validation.\n\n**Key Approaches Used by These Companies for Target ID/Validation:**\n\n*   **Machine Learning on Omics Data:** As discussed, identifying patterns in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Mining scientific literature, patents, and clinical trial databases to extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs.\n*   **Network Biology and Graph Neural Networks:** Modeling complex biological systems and identifying key nodes.\n*   **Image Analysis (Phenotypic Screening):** Analyzing cellular images to understand disease states and identify intervention points.\n*   **Causal Inference Models:** Moving beyond correlation to understand cause-and-effect relationships in biological systems.\n\nIt's important to note that the landscape is dynamic. Companies pivot, merge, and new players emerge frequently. The emphasis on \"AI for target ID/validation\" is a fundamental aspect that underpins almost every AI-driven drug discovery effort.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
